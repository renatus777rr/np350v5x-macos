Samsung NP350V5X Laptop macOS.
THANKS TO DORTANIA GUIDE AND OPENCORE TEAM, THEY MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO RUN MAC OS ON PC, LAPTOPS.
macOS Version i used is Catalina, Big Sur. (Under catalina its works too and bigger than Big Sur is not tested, patch graphics with OCLP and etc too.) (sequoia, sonoma gonna lag 100% i think so)
Download config.plist from source code and place it in OC folder.
Okay to get drivers needed watch dortania guide what kexts needed. and acpi too (ssdt).
Default Kexts that needed for samsung np350v5x drivers :
WhateverGreen.kext
RealtekRTL8111.kext (i used 2.4.2 version to make it work)
The wifi kext for me is unknown so try to find the kext or read update down. maybe i listed wifi there but i didnt know what the kext for it.
AppleALC.kext- audio, for sound and microphone working layout id is 28.
VirtualSMC.kext
Lilu.kext
-- removed intel mausi because who need it. its doesnt do anything.
# UPDATE! bluetooth kext: Ath3kBT.kext, Ath3kBTInjector.kext (or not bluetooth idk) for card reader: RealtekCardReader.kext, RealtekCardReaderFriend.kext. for battery management and etc.. (most kexts that need for greatest work): SMCBatteryManager.kext, SMCSuperIO.kext, SMCLightSensor.kext,SMCProcessor.kext, BrightnessKeys.kext, ECEnabler.kext. FOR SO

Then open config.plist in proper tree and press CMD + SHIFT + R on macOS, Control + Shift + R on windows. And then select EFI/OC folder. and then ok.
Save it. And you have the efi for you. But if you fail to boot, change the smbios. And yeah use Hackintosh-For-All-Computers macOS image. Thanks them for images.
Troubleshooting idk, create an issue. + i dont see this as tutorial.
