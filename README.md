Samsung NP350V5X Laptop macOS.
THANKS TO DORTANIA GUIDE AND OPENCORE TEAM, THEY MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO RUN MAC OS ON PC, LAPTOPS.
macOS Version i used is Catalina, Big Sur. (Under catalina its works too and bigger than Big Sur is not tested, patch graphics with OCLP and etc too.) (sequoia, sonoma gonna lag 100% i think so)
Download config.plist from source code and place it in OC folder.
Okay to get drivers needed watch dortania guide what kexts needed. and acpi too (ssdt).
Default Kexts that needed for samsung np350v5x drivers :
WhateverGreen.kext
RealtekRTL8111.kext (i used 2.4.2 version to make it work)
The wifi kext for me is unknown so try to find the kext or read update down. maybe i listed wifi there but i didnt know what the kext for it.
AppleALC.kext- audio, for sound and microphone working layout id is 28.
VirtualSMC.kext
Lilu.kext
-- removed intel mausi because who need it. its doesnt do anything.
# UPDATE! bluetooth kext: Ath3kBT.kext, Ath3kBTInjector.kext (or not bluetooth idk) for card reader: RealtekCardReader.kext, RealtekCardReaderFriend.kext. for battery management and etc.. (most kexts that need for greatest work): SMCBatteryManager.kext, SMCSuperIO.kext, SMCLightSensor.kext,SMCProcessor.kext, BrightnessKeys.kext, ECEnabler.kext. I didnt used wifi, i used ethernet and also tip use ethernet for fast connection or internet. Use macOS Monterey-Tahoe (whoever uses tahoe???? its gonna lag as ibm pc) for beta or just "new" apps. and patch using oclp because i dont think its gonna be fast or best performance. use better big sur, catalina as it mentioned in dortania guide and for all likely components.
Hardware report in the source of repo. BUT! this is my hardware report, something can be wrong. you can use opcore simplify for making hardware report or hardware named thingy program i forgot the name. the file named as Report.json. Use it for somewhere. Also new kexts that i added, was from open core simplify efi. yeah from prebuilt efi. sorry. just watched up for more kexts taht could be useful. i am not pro in building of hackintoshes.

Then open config.plist in proper tree and press CMD + SHIFT + R on macOS, Control + Shift + R on windows. And then select EFI/OC folder. and then ok.
Save it. And you have the efi for you. But if you fail to boot, change the smbios. And yeah use Hackintosh-For-All-Computers macOS image. Thanks them for images.
Troubleshooting idk, create an issue. + i dont see this as tutorial.
